In this corner you will see a grand monument across from the
history of Breda: the monastery barracks. It is a part of the former
sister monastery St. Catharinadal, which was established here since 1295. The
present building dates from 1504. In 1645 the sisters were Norbetine
expelled from Breda to Oosterhout.
